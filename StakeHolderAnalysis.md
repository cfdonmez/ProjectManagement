## StakeHolder Analysis

Who are the key players

Whos' payin

WhoS gonna fail

### Project Sponsor

We need to understand them such as
what their success criteria
expectations
what their needs

### Project Acceptor

Notes: Sometimes the acceptor and sponsor are the same.. Depends on the sponsors daily life... Remember ASFAT Project..

You must work together with acceptor..  Acceptor makes the coordination, processes, to insure overall business support

### Project Steering Committee

Remember ASFAT Project a guy from ASFAT and Guy from ACCEPTOR company and guys from senior level group.. 
They will eliminate the road blocks, big decisions..

### Interested Parties

who else in the organization has some interest in organization.. may not be directly involved the project, but you know what they wwill be impact .. They can change the process.. They may need to get better information.

### Enemies

Who is don't want to see your success

Look at the internal people in the project.. Don't forget it..
